warnings:
  DAEMON_OLD_VERSION: DAEMON_OLD_VERSION is an important warning; running mixed Ceph daemon versions can lead to unexpected results impacting data availability or consistency. It is recommended to upgrade all daemons to the recommended version ASAP.
  PG_NOT_SCRUBBED: PG_NOT_SCRUBBED warnings are commonly seen in clusters with very large pools. Since individual IOs are checksummed, this warning can be safely muted by increasing the mon_warn_pg_not_scrubbed_ratio. E.g. `ceph config set mon mon_warn_pg_not_scrubbed_ratio 5`.
  PG_NOT_DEEP_SCRUBBED: PG_NOT_DEEP_SCRUBBED warnings are commonly seen in clusters with very large pools. Since individual IOs are checksummed, this warning can be safely muted by increasing the mon_warn_pg_not_deep_scrubbed_ratio. E.g. `ceph config set mon mon_warn_pg_not_deep_scrubbed_ratio 5`.
  MDS_DAMAGE: MDS_DAMAGE is a critical CephFS warning. Contact support.
  MDS_TRIM: MDS_TRIM is a critical warning related to an overload cephfs filesystem. If num_segments is relatively small and this warning comes intermittently, this indicates a performance bottleneck in the meta pool; consider increasing mds_log_warn_factor from the default 2 up to 3 or 4. If num_segments is very large, this indicates a more serious problem; contact support.
  PG_AVAILABILITY: PG_AVAILABILITY is a critical cluster warning -- some data is not available and client IOs will inevitably block. Use `ceph health detail` to identify offline osds, and bring them back online. Do not destroy osds or mark osds lost without expert advice.
  MANY_OBJECTS_PER_PG: MANY_OBJECTS_PER_PG is a non-critical warning. If the identified object distribution is as expected, you can safely mute this warning by setting `ceph config set global mon_pg_warn_max_object_skew 0`.
  MDS_CLIENT_LATE_RELEASE: MDS_CLIENT_LATE_RELEASE is an important CephFS warning indicating a misbehaving client. Identify the relevant client id with `ceph health detail | grep client_id`. Check that client's load_avg with `ceph tell mds.* client ls id=<id> | grep load_avg`. If the workload is very high (e.g. above 10000), then inspect the workload and seek optimizations. Otherwise, if the client has many open files, you may need to increase mds_min_caps_working_set from its default 10000. Otherwise, contact support if this continues.
  OSD_SCRUB_ERRORS: OSD_SCRUB_ERRORS requires manual attention to fix data inconsistencies. Normally a `ceph pg repair <pgid>` fixes the issue. If you find that scrub errors are correlated with a SCSI medium error, it is recommended to enable osd_scrub_auto_repair e.g. `ceph config set osd osd_scrub_auto_repair true`.
  RECENT_CRASH: RECENT_CRASH warnings should be managed via the `ceph crash` command. If you simply want to clear the warning, run `ceph crash prune 0`.
  LARGE_OMAP_OBJECTS: LARGE_OMAP_OBJECTS warnings indicate that deep-scrub has found some RADOS objects with greater than 200k objects. These are normally seen in RGW pools, potentially caused by insufficient bucket index sharding, failed multipart uploads, broken multi site configurations, etc. The exact object names can be found by checking the cluster log ceph.log for further debugging.
